# TextForge
TextForge is a powerful library designed to facilitate text cleaning and preprocessing tasks. Currently, it specializes in cleaning and sanitizing tweets, ensuring that they are ready for further analysis or natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We are actively working on expanding its capabilities and adding more features to make it a comprehensive text processing toolkit.

## Features:
- **Tweet Text Cleaning**: TextForge excels at cleaning and normalizing tweet data, removing noise, emojis, URLs, hashtags, and other artifacts commonly found in tweets. It ensures that the resulting text is well-prepared for subsequent analysis or NLP applications.

## Ongoing Development
We are dedicated to enhancing TextForge and are actively working on the following:
- **Extended Cleaning Options**: We are expanding the cleaning capabilities of TextForge to cover additional text sources beyond tweets, enabling users to process text from various domains and formats.
- **Customization and Configuration**: We are developing features that allow users to customize the cleaning process according to their specific requirements, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to different use cases.
- **Performance Optimization**: We are continuously optimizing the library's performance to ensure efficient and scalable text cleaning operations.
